To run program, copy the CircleOfLife folder to your eclipse workspace folder in your file explorer. Open Eclipse and import the CircleOfLife folder to your workspace as a Java Project. After the workspace is successfully imported, open the CircleOfLife Class and run the program. You can either pick one of the text files included in the folder to run the simulation, or have the program generate one randomly. Each txt file has a "solution" txt file associated with it which shows what the output should be for a specified number of cycles. For example the "1-1cycle.txt" file contains what the "1-3x3.txt" file should output after 1 cycle.
